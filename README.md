This project consists of the Etch-A-Sketch project of the JavaScript Foundations section in The Odin Project. The purpose of this project is to exhibit and display what I have learned so far throughout this curriculum and make adequate, quality use of my skills.

UPDATE (10/2/2025): Made a foundational, functioning, Etch-A-Sketch program. Used with HTML, CSS/Flexbox, and JavaScript. Will see if I want to add any opacity in the future to the blocks.
