/* A solution I discovered was that I had to make all child contents grow within
the parent container(s). We can make the container class the ancestor (martriach), so
all other child and descendant content inside the child containers would need to grow within
the ancestor size as well. */

/* I also had to remove the height and width of the square class, because that was
preventing the squares from resizing to fit within the container. They needed a DYNAMIC
resizing, not a static resizing. */
